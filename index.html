                <p> I enjoy cooking. I recently learned how to cook.
                I love italian mostly but I enjoy any kind of cooking.I have visited many restaurants in <strong>St Louis</strong> and also
                at another states that I have passed by. 
                Eating out encourages gathering and getting together with other. Friends, family and co-workers,
                are all good people to dine with, whe
                n you are out to eat.While I wish I could have spent some quality time with my mother in the kitchen
                so that she could have taught
                me all that I needed to know to get by, it was simply too late once I had graduated from college. It was me,
                an apartment I was subletting for the summer, 
                and a lot of frozen food. It was embarrassing to subject myself to the ABCâ€™s of cooking given how obvious these kinds 
                of skills seemed (and how late in the game it felt for me to be trying them), but I knew that I had to fight against
                my instinct to dive in with the most challenging tasks first</p>

                <p>I started to look at recipes, one by one, and gradually I cooked up some pretty delicious meals that would make my mother proud.</p>

                <p>I have the best of intentions. I buy lots of delicious fresh ingredients and most nights,
                I manage to rustle up something half decent. The overwhelming theme amongst the most dedicated home cooks is that preparation is key, 
                and one of the best ways to do that is meal planning. While you might spend your Sundays relaxing, many dinner devotees
                are using it to get on top of the week's meals. Sure enough these home cooks will end up with delicious meals for the whole week.</p>
